# Solidity_Shraddha 
#  Solidity EVM Course
This course was contains some basic concepts about Web3 and Blockchain with the solidity programming. 
I learnt or try to get all of the concepts through this course which i didn't know at starting phase.
After Completing all three given modules I have to make a contract with the help of this concepts. Specifically mint and burn the token.

## About_Proj.
I have a Project to create contract. In that I created a contract name as MyToken where token name as "kiwi" and token abbreviation as "strawberry" along with its total supply zero (0). If I want to mint some amount of shruti  tokens then it will be added to the total supply of it. Also if I burns those tokens, it will get subtracted from the total supply (Only if there is enough balance).

### Pathway of code 

* I used Online Remix IDE compiler for writing the solidity code Program with a version.
* I created a file which is in the repository named as shraddha.sol for publishing that same code on GitHub.

### Installing

* If you are using Remix IDE then you simply compile the code.
* After compiling the code , you have to deploy the Contract from the option and also check it shows a green tick after compile.
* And after deploying the code , you have to enter certain inputs and run it properly.
